# stuff
Personal config files that might be useful on remote or otherwise "other"
machines.  

Ex: vim .vimrc file and color scheme.

* Vim
  * setup_vim.sh - script to auto copy/merge vimrc, plugins, and color schemes to the home directory
  * .vimrc - vimrc file with useful options and colors schemes
  * plugins
  * color schemes
* tmux
  * .tmux.conf - tmux config file with useful options
* .bashrc - bashrc preferences for UCR CS servers
* other utils
  * sanitize_cs100_debug_log.sh - a log sanitizing script for cs100 rshell test case recording
...I searched trying to figure out how to map *all* keybindings to 'dd'.  But it took much time.
